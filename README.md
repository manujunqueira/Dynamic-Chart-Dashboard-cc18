In this challenge, I created a Dynamic Chart Dashboard using React, Vite, and Chart.js. This dashboard will display various interactive charts (Bar, Line, Scatter, Bubble) based on data fetched from an external file. I also implemented reusable chart components and integrated multiple charts into a single application.
